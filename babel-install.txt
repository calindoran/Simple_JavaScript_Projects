#To install babel for ES6 to ES5 conversion, in terminal write:

npm install babel-cli -D
npm install babel-preset-env -D

'The -D flag instructs npm to add each package to a property called devDependencies in package.json.
Once the project’s dependencies are listed in devDependencies, other developers can run your project 
without installing each package separately. Instead, they can simply run npm install — it instructs 
npm to look inside package.json and download all of the packages listed in devDependencies.'

#To install dependencies:

npm install

'You can specify the initial JavaScript version inside of a file named .babelrc. 
In your root directory, you can run touch .babelrc to create this file.'

'When you run Babel, it looks in .babelrc to determine the version of the initial JavaScript file. 
In this case, ["env"] instructs Babel to transpile any code from versions ES6 and later.'

#Last step to transpile code to ES5.

'In the "scripts" object above, we add a property called "build". 
The property’s value, "babel src -d lib", is a command line method that transpiles ES6+ code to ES5.'

#Add
 "build": "babel src -d lib" 
 to "scripts": {} 
 in package.json


This will transpile code to the 'lib' directory.
Now we use command: 'npm run build'
